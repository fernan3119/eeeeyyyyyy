To run the Java Application follow this steps:

1) Download the zip.
2) Extract the the zip to a folder.
3) Import that project to Eclipse.
4) Do a right click on the folder in eclipse, and press Run As Java Application.
5) Done.

PD I try to find out how to run the application from the terminal, but I can't.
